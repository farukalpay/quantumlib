# QuantumLib

A **modular, high-performance quantum computing library** optimized for classical simulation on macOS M4 Pro and providing seamless deployment on IBM Quantum hardware.

**Features**:
- Advanced circuits (QAOA, UCC, Grover, QFT, QPE, HHL, quantum annealing, kernel-based ML)
- Hybrid optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, SPSA, QNG) with dynamic selection
- Error mitigation (Richardson extrapolation, readout calibration)
- CLI & Notebooks for real-world examples (finance, cryptography, etc.)
- Benchmarks for comparing simulator vs. hardware performance

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
