#quantumlib - A Modular High-Performance Quantum Computing Library
#===============================================================
#researchers, educators, and developers to prototype quantum algorithms
#and applications. It provides a modular and extensible framework for
#building quantum circuits, simulating quantum systems, and running
#quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware. quantumlib is built on top
#of Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing software development framework
#for leveraging today's quantum processors in research, education, and
#business.
